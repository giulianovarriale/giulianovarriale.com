      I started to work with the internet as a web designer, designing and
      developing websites for digital agencies. During this time, I have
      learned the frontend development foundations like HTML and CSS and a
      little bit of javascript - mostly, jQuery plugins initializations. The
      main challenges in this time were related to the layouts and its
      creative navigations and interactions, since agencies love creating
      innovative user experiences.

      As time went by, the web became more dynamic and interactive. In order
      to build a better user experience, things like route handling, views
      rendering and business logic became frontend responsibilities, all of
      it, provided by javascript and its hundreds frameworks and libraries.
      Besides that, nodejs came out, bringing with it, an entire new ecosystem
      with amazing tools.

      I really wanted to work with this new whole environment, so I decided to
      look for a new job where I could use it in my daily basis. I started to
      work for a software boutique company called Codeminer where I have
      learned software design concepts, best practices and, of course,
      javascript. There, I also had my first experience working in a large
      code base, which turned completely my thoughts about how to build an web
      application.

      features for known companies such as
